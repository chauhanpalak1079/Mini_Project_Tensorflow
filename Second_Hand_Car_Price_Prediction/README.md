# Second Hand Car Price Prediction using TensorFlow (Mini Project)
This mini-project aims to predict the prices of second-hand cars based on various features using a machine learning model built with TensorFlow. By analyzing factors like the car's age, mileage, engine power, and brand, the model can provide estimates of car prices, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

# Overview
The second-hand car market is growing rapidly, and accurate pricing models are essential for both sellers and buyers. This TensorFlow-based model predicts the price of a used car based on its key features, such as year of manufacture, mileage, horsepower, and brand.

# Dataset
The dataset used contains historical data of second-hand car sales. Each record includes features such as:

Year: The year the car was manufactured.
Mileage: Total distance the car has traveled.
Horsepower: Engine power of the car.
Brand: The car's brand or manufacturer.
Fuel Type: Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.
Transmission: Manual or Automatic.
This dataset is processed to predict the price of each car based on these features.

# Model Architecture
The neural network for predicting car prices includes:

Input layer: Features such as year, mileage, horsepower, etc.
Hidden layers: Multiple fully connected (dense) layers with ReLU activation functions.
Output layer: A single neuron that outputs the predicted car price as a continuous value.
The model uses the mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function since this is a regression problem, and the Adam optimizer for efficient gradient descent.

# Training the Model
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training set for a number of epochs and evaluated on the test set.

# Example of model training:
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
The model adjusts weights to minimize the difference between predicted and actual car prices using the loss function.

# Evaluation
The model is evaluated based on:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted prices.
R-Squared: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (price) explained by the independent variables (features).
The evaluation metrics give insight into how well the model predicts car prices on unseen data.

# Results
The model achieves a reasonable level of performance with an acceptable MSE and R-squared score. The predictions are close to the actual values, making it a useful tool for pricing second-hand cars.
