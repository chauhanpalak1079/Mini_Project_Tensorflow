# Overview
A brain stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted, which can result in severe health complications. Early prediction of stroke risk can aid in timely medical interventions. This TensorFlow-based model predicts the likelihood of a stroke based on various health and demographic features from patient data, such as age, gender, hypertension, and smoking status.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of health-related features that contribute to the risk of stroke. The key features include:

Age: Patient's age
Gender: Male or Female
Hypertension: Presence of high blood pressure
Heart Disease: History of heart disease
Smoking Status: Whether the patient smokes
BMI: Body Mass Index
Avg Glucose Level: Average glucose level in the blood
This dataset is preprocessed to predict whether a patient is at risk of having a stroke (0 for no stroke, 1 for stroke).

# Model Architecture
The neural network is designed as follows:

Input layer: Consists of the patient's health features.
Hidden layers: Several fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions.
Output layer: A single neuron with sigmoid activation for binary classification (stroke or no stroke).
The model uses binary cross-entropy as the loss function and is optimized using the Adam optimizer.

# Training the Model
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with the model being trained on the training set for several epochs. Validation is performed on the testing set.

# Example of model training:
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
The goal is to minimize the loss and maximize the accuracy of the model's stroke predictions.

# Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated using key metrics:

Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to total predicted positives.
Recall: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
These metrics help assess how well the model identifies patients at risk for stroke.

# Results
The model achieves a reasonable accuracy and performs well in predicting stroke risk. The results show that the neural network can be an effective tool for early detection of stroke, potentially assisting healthcare providers in making informed decisions.
